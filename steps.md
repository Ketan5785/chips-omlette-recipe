step: 1  In a medium bowl, beat eggs until no whites remain, then season with salt, pepper, and a pinch red pepper flakes.

step: 2   In a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Pour in eggs and tilt pan so eggs fully cover the entire pan. As eggs start to set, use a rubber spatula to drag cooked edges into center of pan. Tilt pan to let uncooked egg fall to the edge of the pan. 

step: 3  Once the bottom is set, but top is still a little wet, sprinkle cheese and chives on one half of omelet. Fold other side over cheese and slide omelet onto a plate.
